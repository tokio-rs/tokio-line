/// to make the job of parsing a framed transport simpler.
/// The job of a transport is twofold:
///
/// 1) take the bytes that arrive on our 'inner' (e.g. socket) and chunk them down into frames as
///    Transport::In.
/// 2) take the frames as Transport::Out to send out and turn them into bytes. This allows for
///    example for combining multiple frames into one TCP send.
///
/// The Service only deals in The magic here is that 'inner' must implement 'Readiness' - this allows it to play with Tokio's
/// reactor.
